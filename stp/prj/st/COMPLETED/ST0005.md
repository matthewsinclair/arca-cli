# ST0005: Functional Elixir Codebase Improvements

## Summary

This Steel Thread involved refactoring the Arca CLI codebase to follow functional programming best practices in Elixir. Key improvements include implementing Railway-Oriented Programming for error handling, decomposing complex functions, using pattern matching effectively, and adding comprehensive type specifications.

## Progress Summary

- [x] Created module analysis to identify high-priority refactoring targets
- [x] Refactored main Arca.Cli module with standardized error handling
- [x] Refactored Arca.Cli.Help module with improved pattern matching and function composition
- [x] Refactored Arca.Cli.History module with proper GenServer error handling
- [x] Refactored Arca.Cli.Configurator.Coordinator with Railway-Oriented Programming
- [x] Refactored Arca.Cli.Commands.AboutCommand with Railway-Oriented Programming
- [x] Refactored Arca.Cli.Commands.CliStatusCommand with domain-specific error types
- [x] Refactored Arca.Cli.Commands.SysFlushCommand with proper error handling
- [x] Refactored Arca.Cli.Repl with comprehensive error handling
- [x] Refactored Configuration Command Group (ConfigListCommand, ConfigGetCommand, ConfigHelpCommand)
- [x] Compiled with --warnings-as-errors to ensure type-safety across all modules
- [x] Ensured all 104 tests pass with the refactored codebase

## Steps

1. Analyze codebase to identify modules needing refactoring ✓
2. Establish standard patterns for functional programming principles ✓
3. Apply patterns consistently across modules ✓
4. Test to ensure backward compatibility and stability ✓
5. Update documentation to reflect new patterns ✓

## Status

Completed - Successfully refactored 12 high-priority modules with Railway-Oriented Programming patterns, comprehensive error handling, and proper type specifications. These improvements laid the groundwork for integrating the latest version of Arca.Config in ST0006.
