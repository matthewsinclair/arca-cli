# ST0002: REPL Tab Completion Improvements

## Metadata

- **ID**: ST0002
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Created**: 20250226
- **Completed**: 
- **Owner**: Matthew Sinclair
- **Priority**: Medium

## Objective

Enhance the tab completion functionality in Arca.Cli's REPL mode to provide a more intuitive and efficient command-line experience, particularly for hierarchical (dot notation) commands.

## Context

Arca.Cli includes a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) mode that allows for interactive command execution. The project recently implemented hierarchical command organization using dot notation (e.g., "sys.info", "cli.status"). While basic tab completion exists, there's room for improvement in its handling of namespaced commands and integration with external tools like rlwrap.

## Approach

1. Analyze the current tab completion implementation and identify limitations
2. Design enhancements for completion of dot notation commands
3. Implement intelligent suggestions for partial namespace matches
4. Create a completion generator script for external tools like rlwrap
5. Update the REPL module to detect and adjust to terminal capabilities
6. Test with various command structures and in different terminal environments

## Tasks

- [x] Implement tab completion for hierarchical commands using dot notation
- [x] Create completion generator script for rlwrap integration
- [x] Modify REPL script to use rlwrap when available
- [x] Add special handling for namespace prefixes (e.g., typing "sys" shows available commands in that namespace)
- [x] Fix REPL auto-suggestion display logic to prevent showing suggestions for complete commands
- [ ] Add support for completing command parameters and options
- [ ] Optimize completion performance for large command sets
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for completion functionality
- [ ] Update documentation to explain completion capabilities

## Implementation Notes

- The completion functionality was implemented using a combination of Elixir pattern matching and string operations
- Integrated rlwrap for improved history and completion handling in terminals that support it
- Implemented a fallback mechanism for terminals without rlwrap support
- Created specialized handling for namespace prefixes to improve discoverability
- Fixed an issue where "Suggestions:" text would inappropriately display for complete commands

## Results

Work is still in progress, but the following improvements have been implemented:

- More intuitive tab completion for hierarchical commands
- Better user experience with command discovery (typing a namespace prefix shows available commands)
- Improved terminal integration with rlwrap support
- Fixed display issues with suggestion text

When completed, tab completion will work seamlessly across different terminal environments and provide intelligent completion for both commands and their parameters.
