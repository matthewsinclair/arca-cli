# ST0001: Documentation Migration to STP

## Metadata

- **ID**: ST0001
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Created**: 20250306
- **Completed**: 
- **Owner**: Matthew Sinclair
- **Priority**: High

## Objective

Migrate existing Arca.Cli documentation from the doc/ directory to the new STP framework structure, ensuring all content is properly organized and formatted according to STP standards.

## Context

The Arca.Cli project has existing documentation in the doc/ directory, including a user guide and development journal. The project has adopted the Steel Thread Project (STP) framework for documentation organization. This steel thread addresses the migration of existing documentation to the new structure.

## Approach

1. Review the existing documentation in doc/ directory
2. Understand the STP framework structure and requirements
3. Create appropriate STP documents in the stp/ directory
4. Migrate and reformat content from the existing documents to STP format
5. Update references and links to ensure document interconnectivity
6. Validate that all documentation is consistent and follows STP conventions

## Tasks

- [x] Read and understand the STP framework documentation
- [x] Set up initial STP directory structure
- [x] Migrate user guide content to stp/usr/user_guide.md
- [x] Create comprehensive reference guide in stp/usr/reference_guide.md
- [x] Create deployment guide in stp/usr/deployment_guide.md
- [x] Transfer historical development information to stp/prj/journal.md
- [x] Update stp/prj/wip.md with current development focus
- [x] Set up steel thread documentation in stp/prj/st/
- [ ] Validate cross-references and links between documents
- [ ] Review all migrated documentation for completeness and consistency

## Implementation Notes

- The original user guide in doc/user_guide.md contained comprehensive information that was split between the user guide and reference guide in the STP structure
- The development journal in doc/arca_cli_journal.md was reformatted with consistent date formatting and organized with descriptive headers
- Added versioning information to all documents using the STP verblock format

## Results

Work is still in progress, but upon completion, the following benefits will be realized:

- Better organized documentation that follows a consistent structure
- Improved separation of concerns between user-focused and reference documentation
- More comprehensive development tracking through project journal and steel threads
- Foundation for future documentation improvements
