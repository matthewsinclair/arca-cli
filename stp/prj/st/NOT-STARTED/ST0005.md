# ST0004: Functional Elixir Codebase Improvements

## Overview

This steel thread focuses on systematically improving the Arca.Cli codebase by applying functional programming principles in Elixir. It aims to enhance code quality, maintainability, and readability through consistent patterns across the codebase.

## Status: In Progress

## Current Progress

1. **Completed Modules**:
   - None

2. **Next Modules to Refactor**:
   - Arca.Cli modules

## Key Refactoring Patterns Applied

1. **Railway-Oriented Programming**:
   - Using `with` expressions for cleaner error flows
   - Consistent error tuple returns: `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason_type, reason}`

2. **Functional Composition**:
   - Breaking down large functions into smaller, focused helper functions
   - Using pipe operators (`|>`) for data transformations

3. **Pattern Matching Over Conditionals**:
   - Replacing nested `if/else` and `cond` with pattern-matched function heads
   - Using guards for cleaner type-based branching

4. **Context Passing Pattern**:
   - Adding pipeline-friendly function variants that accept and return contexts
   - Using `with_x` naming convention for context-passing functions

5. **Comprehensive Type Specifications**:
   - Adding `@spec` annotations for all public functions
   - Defining type aliases for common data structures and return types

6. **Telemetry Integration**:
   - Adding telemetry spans for performance monitoring
   - Including rich metadata with operation details

## Implementation Details

### Completed in Last Session

{{TBD}}

## Next Steps

1. Refactor priority modules according to the established patterns
2. Start with the Arca.Cli modules as the next refactoring target
3. Follow the patterns established in the previous refactorings
4. Update documentation with examples of functional programming patterns
