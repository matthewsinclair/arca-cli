# 6. Deployment and Operations

## 6.1 Deployment Models

### 6.1.1 Library Dependency

The primary deployment model for Arca.Cli is as a library dependency in Elixir projects:

1. Add Arca.Cli to the project's dependencies in `mix.exs`:
   ```elixir
   def deps do
     [
       {:arca_cli, "~> 0.3.0"}
     ]
   end
   ```

2. Configure the CLI in the application's configuration:
   ```elixir
   # In config/config.exs
   config :arca_cli, :configurators, [
     YourApp.Cli.Configurator,
     Arca.Cli.Configurator.DftConfigurator
   ]
   ```

3. Create custom configurators and commands as needed

4. Access the CLI through a Mix task or direct application invocation

### 6.1.2 Standalone Executable

Arca.Cli can also be deployed as a standalone executable:

1. Build the executable using Mix:
   ```bash
   mix escript.build
   ```

2. Distribute the resulting `arca_cli` executable

3. Install the executable in a directory included in the system PATH

### 6.1.3 Development Tool

Arca.Cli can be used as a development tool within projects:

1. Add Arca.Cli to the project's dev dependencies in `mix.exs`
2. Create project-specific commands for development tasks
3. Access the CLI through Mix or scripts during development

## 6.2 Installation Requirements

### 6.2.1 System Requirements

Minimum system requirements:

- Elixir 1.14 or higher
- Erlang/OTP 25 or higher
- POSIX-compatible shell (for script integration)
- 50MB available disk space
- Terminal with Unicode support

### 6.2.2 Optional Dependencies

Optional components for enhanced functionality:

- `rlwrap` for improved REPL experience with line editing and history
- `jq` for processing JSON configuration files (for administrators)
- Syntax highlighting terminal for improved readability

### 6.2.3 Environment Setup

Recommended environment configuration:

1. Configure environment variables (if using custom paths):
   ```bash
   export ARCA_CONFIG_PATH="$HOME/.config/arca/"
   export ARCA_CONFIG_FILE="config.json"
   ```

2. Ensure adequate file permissions for configuration directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/arca"
   chmod 700 "$HOME/.config/arca"
   ```

## 6.3 Configuration Management

### 6.3.1 Configuration Hierarchy

Arca.Cli configuration follows this hierarchy (in order of precedence):

1. Command-line arguments and flags
2. Environment variables
3. User configuration file
4. Application configuration
5. Default values

### 6.3.2 Configuration File Format

The configuration file uses JSON format:

```json
{
  "id": "arca_cli",
  "version": "0.3.0",
  "settings": {
    "history": {
      "max_size": 100,
      "persistence": true
    },
    "repl": {
      "prompt": "> ",
      "show_suggestions": true
    }
  }
}
```

### 6.3.3 Configuration Backup and Recovery

Recommended practices for configuration management:

1. Regularly back up configuration files
2. Use version control for custom configurators and commands
3. Document configuration changes
4. Maintain a recovery procedure for corrupted configurations

## 6.4 Monitoring and Maintenance

### 6.4.1 Logging

Arca.Cli provides logging through:

- Standard output for normal operation
- Standard error for error messages
- Application-specific logging if integrated with a host application

Logging levels can be controlled through configuration.

### 6.4.2 Performance Monitoring

Key performance metrics to monitor:

- Startup time
- Command execution time
- Memory usage
- History file size

### 6.4.3 Regular Maintenance Tasks

Recommended maintenance procedures:

1. Update to the latest version regularly
2. Prune history files if they grow excessively large
3. Review and update custom commands when upgrading
4. Validate configuration files after major updates

## 6.5 Troubleshooting

### 6.5.1 Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Causes | Solutions |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Command not found | Missing registration, typo | Verify command registration, check spelling |
| Configuration errors | Corrupt file, permission issues | Reset configuration, check permissions |
| REPL tab completion issues | Terminal capabilities, rlwrap missing | Install rlwrap, verify terminal support |
| Slow performance | Large history file, many commands | Prune history, optimize commands |
| Integration issues | Version conflicts, missing configuration | Verify dependencies, check application config |

### 6.5.2 Diagnostic Commands

Built-in diagnostic commands:

- `status`: Show current CLI status and configuration
- `sys.info`: Display system information
- `settings.all`: List all current settings

### 6.5.3 Support Resources

Available support resources:

- Documentation on HexDocs
- GitHub Issues for bug reports
- Elixir Forum for community support
- Project maintainers for critical issues

## 6.6 Security Considerations

### 6.6.1 Command Execution Security

Security considerations for command execution:

- Commands with system access should be carefully reviewed
- User input should be validated and sanitized
- Sensitive commands should require confirmation
- Privilege escalation should be avoided

### 6.6.2 Configuration Security

Security considerations for configuration:

- Configuration files may contain sensitive information
- Restrict access to configuration directories
- Consider encrypting sensitive settings
- Avoid storing credentials in configuration when possible

### 6.6.3 Dependency Security

Security considerations for dependencies:

- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- Minimize use of external dependencies
- Use trusted sources for dependencies

## 6.7 Disaster Recovery

### 6.7.1 Backup Procedures

Recommended backup procedures:

1. Back up configuration files regularly
2. Store custom commands and configurators in version control
3. Document customizations and extensions
4. Create scripts to regenerate or restore configuration

### 6.7.2 Recovery Procedures

Recovery procedures for common disasters:

1. Corrupted configuration file:
   - Restore from backup or recreate with default settings

2. Broken commands after update:
   - Revert to previous version
   - Update command implementation for compatibility

3. Dependency conflicts:
   - Lock dependencies at compatible versions
   - Create isolation through application boundaries

### 6.7.3 Contingency Planning

Contingency plans for critical failures:

1. Maintain documented fallback procedures
2. Test recovery procedures periodically
3. Create emergency contact information for support
4. Document workarounds for known issues
