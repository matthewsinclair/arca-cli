# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose

Arca.Cli is a flexible command-line interface framework for Elixir applications. This document provides a comprehensive technical design for the Arca.Cli system, outlining its architecture, implementation details, and development roadmap.

## 1.2 Scope

This Technical Product Design (TPD) covers:

- Overall system architecture and design principles
- Component design and interactions
- Implementation details and constraints
- Integration considerations
- Development roadmap

## 1.3 System Overview

Arca.Cli provides a robust framework for building command-line applications in Elixir, featuring:

- A modular command architecture
- Hierarchical command organization with dot notation
- Interactive REPL mode with command history and tab completion
- Configurator system for extensibility
- Built-in commands for common operations

The system is designed to be lightweight, extensible, and easily integrated into other Elixir applications as a dependency.

## 1.4 Design Goals

The primary design goals for Arca.Cli are:

1. **Modularity**: Provide a clean separation of concerns between commands, configuration, and execution
2. **Extensibility**: Make it easy to add new commands and functionality
3. **Usability**: Create an intuitive interface for both end-users and developers
4. **Reliability**: Ensure robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. **Performance**: Minimize overhead and resource usage

## 1.5 Intended Audience

This document is intended for:

- Developers contributing to the Arca.Cli project
- Maintainers responsible for the project's ongoing development
- Technical stakeholders evaluating the system for integration

## 1.6 Document Conventions

Throughout this document:

- Module names are written in PascalCase (e.g., `Arca.Cli.Commands.AboutCommand`)
- Function names are written in snake_case (e.g., `handle/3`)
- Terms in italics *indicate* important concepts
- Code snippets are formatted as follows:

```elixir
defmodule Example do
  def sample_function(arg) do
    # Implementation
  end
end
```
