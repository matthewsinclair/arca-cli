## Code Style Guidelines

- Shell scripts: 2-space indentation, POSIX compliance
- Markdown: Standard formatting with verblock headers
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

## Testing Instructions

All changes should be validated with the test suite before committing.

1. Run the full test suite before making changes to establish baseline
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests again to ensure nothing broke
4. Add new tests for new functionality

## Commit and PR Guidelines

### Commit Messages

- Be descriptive about what changed and why
- Reference steel thread IDs (e.g., "ST0018: Add AGENTS.md support")

### Pull Requests
- Include test results in PR description
- Reference related steel threads
- Update documentation alongside code changes

## Intent-Specific Information

### Steel Thread Process
This project uses Intent's Steel Thread Process for development:
- Work is organized into steel threads (ST####)
- Each thread is a self-contained unit of work
- View threads: `intent st list`
- Create thread: `intent st new "Title"`

### Available Commands
```bash
intent st list              # List all steel threads
intent st new "Title"       # Create new steel thread
intent st show <id>         # Show steel thread details
intent bl                   # Manage backlog (if configured)
intent doctor              # Check configuration
intent agents sync         # Update this AGENTS.md file
```

## Security Considerations

- Never commit sensitive information (keys, passwords, tokens)
- Review all changes for security implications
- Follow secure coding practices
