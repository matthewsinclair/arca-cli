# ST0010: HEREDOC injection for cli.script

## Objective

Add heredoc-style stdin injection to `.cli` script files, enabling automation of interactive commands (like `ll.play`, `ll.agent.engage`, `ll.llm.chat`) without requiring manual input.

## Context

### The Problem

Currently, `cli.script` can execute CLI commands from `.cli` files but cannot inject input into interactive commands. When a command expects user input via `IO.gets/1` or similar, the script execution blocks waiting for input that never comes.

Example that doesn't work today:

```
ll.play the_conundra --trace
Hello Sam!          # This becomes another command (fails)
What do you think?  # This also becomes another command (fails)
/exit               # This also becomes another command (fails)
```

This prevents:

- Automated testing of interactive narrative flows
- Scripted demos and recordings
- CI/CD testing of agent engagement scenarios
- Batch processing of LLM conversations

### The Solution

Add bash-style heredoc syntax to `.cli` files:

```
ll.play the_conundra --trace <<EOF
Hello Sam!
What do you think?
/exit
EOF
```

This uses Elixir's Group Leader redirection pattern to inject stdin without modifying commands.

### Design Principles

1. **Simple**: MVP supports basic `<<MARKER ... MARKER` syntax only
2. **Idiomatic**: Uses Elixir's Group Leader mechanism (standard IO redirection pattern)
3. **Self-contained**: Commands don't need to know about heredocs
4. **Backward compatible**: Existing `.cli` files continue to work unchanged
5. **Consistent**: Follows shell scripting conventions (heredoc is familiar to users)

## Syntax Specification

### Basic Heredoc

```
command <<MARKER
line 1
line 2
line 3
MARKER
```

- Marker must appear at end of command line after a space
- Content lines captured verbatim (preserving whitespace)
- Closing marker must appear on its own line
- Each line sent to command's stdin as if user typed it + Enter
- EOF sent automatically after last line

### Supported Markers

Initial implementation supports any alphanumeric marker (typically `EOF`, `END`, `INPUT`, etc.)

### Example Use Cases

**Interactive narrative:**

```
ll.world.mount lecarre.circus
ll.play the_conundra --trace <<EOF
Hello Sam!
What do you think about this situation?
/exit
EOF
```

**Agent engagement:**

```
ll.agent.engage my_agent <<EOF
analyze this data
show me the results
/done
EOF
```

**LLM chat session:**

```
ll.llm.chat <<EOF
What is the meaning of life?
Can you elaborate?
/exit
EOF
```

## Scope & Limitations

### MVP (Phase 1)

- ✅ Single heredoc per command
- ✅ Simple `<<MARKER` syntax
- ✅ Works with standard Elixir `IO.gets/1`, `IO.read/2`, etc.
- ✅ Clear error messages for unclosed heredocs
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing `.cli` files

### Known Limitations

- ❌ No nested heredocs
- ❌ No variable interpolation in heredoc content
- ❌ No support for commands using `ExPrompt` or custom IO (may work, but not guaranteed)
- ❌ If heredoc content contains the EOF marker, it terminates early (use different marker)
- ❌ No indentation stripping (`<<-` style not supported in v1)

### Not in Scope (Future Enhancements)

- Multiple heredocs per command
- Quoted markers (`<<'EOF'` vs `<<EOF`) for interpolation control
- Tab-stripping heredocs (`<<-EOF`)
- Include external files (`<<< file.txt`)
- Conditional heredocs

## Implementation Overview

### Key Components

1. **Parser Enhancement** (`cli_script_command.ex`)
   - State machine: `:normal` ↔ `:in_heredoc`
   - Detects `<<MARKER` at end of command line
   - Accumulates lines until closing `MARKER`
   - Returns `{:command_with_stdin, cmd, stdin_lines}`

2. **InputProvider GenServer** (new module)
   - Implements Erlang IO protocol
   - Serves heredoc lines when command calls `IO.gets/1`
   - Returns `:eof` when exhausted

3. **Group Leader Redirection** (execution in `cli_script_command.ex`)
   - Spawns `InputProvider` with heredoc lines
   - Temporarily sets it as process group leader
   - Executes command (stdin calls redirected to provider)
   - Restores original group leader after execution

### Why This Approach?

**Elixir-idiomatic**: Group leader pattern is the standard way to redirect IO in Elixir/Erlang (used by ExUnit, Logger, etc.)

**Non-invasive**: Commands don't need modification - they continue using `IO.gets/1` normally

**Testable**: InputProvider can be tested independently; existing command tests unaffected

**Simple**: No complex piping, no OS-level stdin manipulation, no Port hackery
