# Completed Tasks - ST0010: HEREDOC injection for cli.script

## Completion Summary

All tasks completed on: 2025-10-29
Total time: ~3-4 hours (under the 9-14 hour estimate)
Final status: 456 tests passing, 0 failures, 0 warnings

## Phase 1: Core Implementation (COMPLETE)

### [x] T1: Create InputProvider GenServer
**Status**: COMPLETE
**File**: `lib/arca_cli/commands/input_provider.ex`

Completed:
- Implemented Erlang IO protocol with pattern-matched function heads
- Handles `{:get_line, prompt}` requests
- Handles `{:get_chars, prompt, count}` requests
- Returns `:eof` when lines exhausted
- Added comprehensive @moduledoc with usage examples
- Pure functional implementation with zero nested conditionals

### [x] T2: Add heredoc parser to cli_script_command.ex
**Status**: COMPLETE
**File**: `lib/arca_cli/commands/cli_script_command.ex`

Completed:
- Created `parse_script/1` function with clean pipelines
- Implemented `parse_lines/4` with state machine
- States: `:normal` and `{:in_heredoc, cmd, marker, lines, start_line}`
- Regex for detecting heredoc start: `~r/^(.+?)\s+<<(\w+)$/`
- Returns `{:ok, commands}` or `{:error, {:unclosed_heredoc, marker, line}}`
- Preserves line numbers for error reporting
- Pattern-matched classification functions

### [x] T3: Update command execution in cli_script_command.ex
**Status**: COMPLETE
**File**: `lib/arca_cli/commands/cli_script_command.ex`

Completed:
- Modified `process_script_commands/3` to call parser
- Created `execute_command/3` with pattern matching:
  - `{:command, cmd}` -> existing behavior
  - `{:command_with_stdin, cmd, marker, lines}` -> heredoc with group leader swap
- Implemented `with_stdin_provider/2` helper
- Group leader redirection with proper cleanup:
  - Start InputProvider
  - Save original `Process.group_leader()`
  - Set provider as group leader
  - Execute command
  - Restore original group leader in `try...after`
  - Stop InputProvider
- Error handling for all failure modes

### [x] T4: Error handling and reporting
**Status**: COMPLETE

Completed:
- Handles unclosed heredoc error from parser
- Formats error message with line numbers: "Unclosed heredoc starting at line X: expected 'MARKER' but reached end of file"
- Raises with clear error context
- Proper cleanup in all error scenarios via `try...after`

## Phase 2: Testing (COMPLETE)

### [x] T5: Unit tests for InputProvider
**Status**: COMPLETE
**File**: `test/arca_cli/commands/input_provider_test.exs`

Completed:
- 14 comprehensive tests
- Tests serving lines via `IO.gets/1`
- Tests returning `:eof` when exhausted
- Tests `IO.getn/2` character reading
- Tests empty stdin list
- Tests concurrent usage
- All tests passing

### [x] T6: Parser unit tests
**Status**: COMPLETE
**File**: `test/arca_cli/commands/cli_script_command_test.exs`

Completed:
- Test simple heredoc parsing
- Test multiple heredocs in one script
- Test mixed regular commands and heredocs
- Test unclosed heredoc error detection with line numbers
- Test whitespace preservation
- Test various marker names (EOF, END, INPUT123, DATA)
- Test Windows line endings (CRLF)
- Test empty heredoc (no lines between markers)
- Test heredoc with only whitespace
- All edge cases covered

### [x] T7: Integration tests
**Status**: COMPLETE
**File**: `test/arca_cli/commands/cli_script_command_test.exs`

Completed:
- Tests via file interface (heredoc parsing through execution)
- Test heredoc injection with commands
- Test backward compatibility (existing .cli files still work)
- Test error scenarios (unclosed heredoc with proper error messages)
- Test edge cases (long heredoc, unicode content)
- All 456 tests passing in full suite

### [x] T8: Real-world command testing
**Status**: COMPLETE (via test harness)

Completed:
- Created test infrastructure that captures IO
- Verified heredoc mechanism works end-to-end
- Tests simulate real command execution
- Integration confirmed via full test suite

## Phase 3: Documentation (COMPLETE)

### [x] T9: Add heredoc examples to test fixtures
**Status**: COMPLETE
**File**: `test/fixtures/scripts/test_heredoc.cli`

Completed:
- Created comprehensive test fixture
- Examples of each use case
- Documented expected behavior in comments
- Additional demo file: `examples/heredoc_demo.cli`

### [x] T10: Update cli.script help text
**Status**: COMPLETE
**File**: `lib/arca_cli/commands/cli_script_command.ex`

Completed:
- Added heredoc syntax to @moduledoc
- Included usage examples
- Documented syntax in command description

### [x] T11: Update project documentation
**Status**: COMPLETE

Completed:
- Created `intent/st/ST0010/info.md` - Project overview
- Created `intent/st/ST0010/design.md` - Technical design
- Created `intent/st/ST0010/impl.md` - Implementation summary
- Created `intent/st/ST0010/tasks.md` - Task breakdown
- Created `intent/st/ST0010/done.md` - This file
- Examples with common use cases
- Documented known limitations
- Added troubleshooting notes in design.md

## Phase 4: Polish (COMPLETE)

### [x] T12: Code review and cleanup
**Status**: COMPLETE

Completed:
- Reviewed all changes for consistency
- Pure functional approach throughout
- Pattern matching instead of conditionals
- Consistent naming conventions
- Edge cases properly handled
- Zero compiler warnings

### [x] T13: Performance testing
**Status**: COMPLETE

Completed:
- Test with large heredocs (10,000+ character lines)
- Test with multiple heredocs in one script
- No memory leaks detected
- All tests run efficiently
- Group leader cleanup verified

### [x] T14: Final testing
