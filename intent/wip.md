# Work In Progress

## Current Status

### Recently Completed

**ST0010: HEREDOC injection for cli.script** - COMPLETE (2025-10-29)
- Implemented bash-style heredoc syntax for .cli scripts
- Enables stdin injection into interactive commands
- Pure functional Elixir with pattern matching throughout
- 456 tests passing, 0 failures, 0 warnings
- Files: `lib/arca_cli/commands/input_provider.ex`, enhanced `cli_script_command.ex`
- Time: 3-4 hours (under 9-14 hour estimate)

### Current Focus

No active work in progress.

### Pending Work

None identified at this time.

## Notes

The Arca.Cli project provides a robust command-line interface framework for Elixir applications. The project uses the Intent framework (v2.2.0) for managing steel threads and development work.

Recent completion of ST0010 adds heredoc functionality to cli.script, allowing automated testing and scripting of interactive commands. The implementation uses Elixir's Group Leader pattern to redirect stdin without modifying commands.

## Context for LLM

This document captures the current state of development on the project. When beginning work with an LLM assistant, start by sharing this document to provide context about what's currently being worked on.

### How to use this document

1. Update the "Current Focus" section with what you're currently working on
2. List active steel threads with their IDs and brief descriptions
3. Keep track of upcoming work items
4. Add any relevant notes that might be helpful for yourself or the LLM

When starting a new steel thread, describe it here first, then ask the LLM to create the appropriate steel thread document using the STP commands.
