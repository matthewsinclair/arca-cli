# 2. Requirements

## 2.1 Functional Requirements

### 2.1.1 Command Execution

1. The system shall provide a mechanism to define and execute commands
2. The system shall support command arguments, options, and flags
3. The system shall validate command inputs before execution
4. The system shall provide meaningful error messages for invalid inputs
5. The system shall support hierarchical command organization using dot notation

### 2.1.2 Interactive Mode (REPL)

1. The system shall provide an interactive REPL mode for command execution
2. The REPL shall support command history navigation
3. The REPL shall provide tab completion for commands
4. The REPL shall display helpful suggestions for partial or unknown commands
5. The REPL shall support special commands (e.g., help, exit, history)

### 2.1.3 Configuration Management

1. The system shall maintain configuration settings between sessions
2. The system shall provide commands to view and modify configuration
3. The system shall support environment variables for configuration overrides
4. The system shall provide sensible defaults for all configuration options

### 2.1.4 Command History

1. The system shall record executed commands in a history
2. The system shall provide commands to view history
3. The system shall allow re-execution of previous commands
4. The system shall persist command history between sessions

### 2.1.5 Extensibility

1. The system shall provide a clear mechanism for adding new commands
2. The system shall support custom command handling logic
3. The system shall allow for extending or overriding default behaviors
4. The system shall provide hooks for command lifecycle events

## 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.2.1 Performance

1. The system shall start up within 500ms
2. Command execution time shall not exceed 100ms (excluding command-specific processing)
3. The system shall handle large command histories (1000+ entries) without significant performance degradation
4. Memory usage shall remain below 50MB during normal operation

### 2.2.2 Reliability

1. The system shall gracefully handle and report errors without crashing
2. The system shall prevent data loss in command history
3. The system shall validate configuration file integrity during startup
4. The system shall recover from corrupted configuration files

### 2.2.3 Usability

1. Command syntax shall follow common CLI conventions
2. Help output shall be clear and consistently formatted
3. Error messages shall be descriptive and suggest possible solutions
4. The REPL interface shall provide a responsive and intuitive experience

### 2.2.4 Maintainability

1. The codebase shall follow Elixir best practices and style guidelines
2. The system shall be well-documented with module and function documentation
3. The codebase shall include comprehensive test coverage
4. The system shall use established libraries for parsing and other standard functionality

### 2.2.5 Compatibility

1. The system shall run on Elixir 1.14 or higher
2. The system shall run on Erlang/OTP 25 or higher
3. The system shall support major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows with WSL)
4. The system shall support Unicode input and output

## 2.3 Constraints

### 2.3.1 Technical Constraints

1. The system shall be implemented in Elixir
2. The system shall be packaged as a Hex package
3. External dependencies shall be minimized and carefully evaluated
4. The system shall be compatible with both Mix projects and standalone usage

### 2.3.2 Resource Constraints

1. The system shall be developed with limited developer resources
2. The development schedule shall prioritize core functionality
3. The system shall be designed for ease of maintenance by a small team

## 2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies

### 2.4.1 Assumptions

1. Users have basic familiarity with command-line interfaces
2. The Elixir runtime is installed and properly configured
3. Terminal environments support standard control sequences

### 2.4.2 Dependencies

1. The system depends on the Optimus library for command-line parsing
2. The system optionally integrates with rlwrap for enhanced REPL capabilities
3. The system uses standard Elixir/Erlang libraries for file system operations
