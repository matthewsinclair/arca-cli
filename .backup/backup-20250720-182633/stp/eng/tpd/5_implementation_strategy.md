# 5. Implementation Strategy

## 5.1 Development Approach

### 5.1.1 Incremental Development

Arca.Cli is developed using an incremental approach, with each iteration adding functionality while maintaining backward compatibility. The development process follows these principles:

- Start with a minimal viable product (MVP) focused on core functionality
- Add features incrementally, testing each addition thoroughly
- Refactor code for clarity and maintainability as the system evolves
- Ensure backward compatibility for existing applications

### 5.1.2 Testing Strategy

Testing is an integral part of the development process:

- Unit tests for individual functions and modules
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete command execution
- Property-based tests for complex logic

### 5.1.3 Documentation-Driven Development

The project employs a documentation-driven approach:

- Document requirements and design before implementation
- Write function and module documentation during development
- Update documentation in parallel with code changes
- Create comprehensive user and reference guides

## 5.2 Implementation Phases

### 5.2.1 Phase 1: Core Framework

The initial phase focuses on the core command execution framework:

- Basic command parsing and execution
- Command registration system
- Simple configuration management
- Core utility functions

**Status**: Completed

### 5.2.2 Phase 2: REPL and History

The second phase adds interactive capabilities:

- REPL implementation
- Command history tracking
- Basic tab completion
- History persistence

**Status**: Completed

### 5.2.3 Phase 3: Configurator System

The third phase enhances configuration capabilities:

- Configurator behaviour definition
- Configurator coordination
- Settings management
- Environment variable integration

**Status**: Completed

### 5.2.4 Phase 4: Command Enhancements

The fourth phase improves the command system:

- Macro-based DSL for command definition
- Enhanced error handling and reporting
- Command validation improvements
- Hierarchical command organization

**Status**: Completed

### 5.2.5 Phase 5: Advanced Features

The current phase focuses on advanced features:

- Enhanced tab completion with dot notation support
- External tool integration (rlwrap)
- Subcommand support
- Performance optimizations

**Status**: In Progress

### 5.2.6 Future Phases

Planned future enhancements:

- Plugin system for third-party extensions
- Enhanced parameter validation
- Interactive help system
- Command suggestion improvements

## 5.3 Development Tools and Environment

### 5.3.1 Development Tools

The project uses these development tools:

- **Elixir/Erlang**: Primary programming language and runtime
- **Mix**: Build tool for dependency management and testing
- **ExUnit**: Testing framework
- **Dialyxir**: Static type checking
- **Credo**: Code style checking

### 5.3.2 Development Environment

Recommended development environment:

- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code with ElixirLS extension
- **Terminal**: iTerm2 (macOS) or similar with Unicode support
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub

### 5.3.3 Build and Test Scripts

The project includes several scripts to facilitate development:

- `./scripts/test`: Run all tests
- `./scripts/iex`: Launch IEx with the application loaded
- `./scripts/repl`: Launch the REPL with proper configuration
- `./scripts/cli`: Execute the CLI directly
- `./scripts/update_completions`: Update tab completion definitions

## 5.4 Coding Standards and Guidelines

### 5.4.1 Code Style

The project follows Elixir's style guides:

- Use **snake_case** for variables and functions
- Use **PascalCase** for module names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add type specifications for public functions
- Document modules and functions
- Format code with `mix format`

### 5.4.2 Error Handling

Guidelines for error handling:

- Return `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}` tuples for operations that may fail
- Use exceptions only for exceptional cases
- Provide clear error messages with actionable information
- Handle errors at the appropriate level of abstraction

### 5.4.3 Testing Guidelines

Guidelines for tests:

- Write both unit and integration tests
- Test happy paths and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies when necessary
- Organize tests to match the module structure
- Keep tests independent and idempotent

### 5.4.4 Documentation Guidelines

Guidelines for documentation:

- Document every module with `@moduledoc`
- Document public functions with `@doc`
- Provide examples using doctests where appropriate
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

## 5.5 Deployment Strategy

### 5.5.1 Package Publication

Arca.Cli is published as a Hex package:

- Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for version numbers
- Maintain a CHANGELOG.md with version history
- Publish to Hex.pm with appropriate metadata
- Update documentation on HexDocs

### 5.5.2 Release Process

The release process includes:

1. Update version number in mix.exs
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with new changes
3. Run the full test suite
4. Tag the release in Git
5. Publish to Hex.pm
6. Update documentation

### 5.5.3 Backward Compatibility

Guidelines for maintaining backward compatibility:

- Avoid breaking changes in minor versions
- Deprecate features before removing them
- Provide migration paths for major version changes
- Document changes clearly in release notes

## 5.6 Risk Management

### 5.6.1 Technical Risks

Identified technical risks and mitigation strategies:

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Compatibility issues with terminal environments | Medium | Medium | Test in multiple environments, provide fallbacks |
| Performance degradation with large command sets | Medium | Low | Implement optimization strategies, benchmark regularly |
| Integration issues with host applications | High | Medium | Create comprehensive integration tests, document integration patterns |
| Dependency version conflicts | Medium | Medium | Minimize external dependencies, test with various dependency versions |

### 5.6.2 Resource Risks

Identified resource risks and mitigation strategies:

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Limited development resources | High | High | Prioritize features, leverage community contributions |
| Knowledge concentration | Medium | Medium | Maintain thorough documentation, encourage multiple contributors |
| Community adoption challenges | Medium | Medium | Focus on usability, provide comprehensive examples |

### 5.6.3 Risk Response Strategies

Strategies for addressing risks:

- **Monitor**: Track key performance metrics and user feedback
- **Mitigate**: Implement preventive measures for high-priority risks
- **Accept**: For low-impact risks, document known limitations
- **Contingency**: Develop backup plans for high-impact risks
