# Heredoc Demo Script
# Demonstrates stdin injection for interactive commands

# This script shows how to use heredoc syntax to automate
# interactive CLI commands that normally require user input.

# Example 1: Simple heredoc with EOF marker
# Note: These commands would work with actual interactive commands
# like ll.play, ll.agent.engage, or ll.llm.chat

# Simulated conversation with an interactive command
# (In real usage, this would be a command that reads from stdin)
echo.example <<EOF
Hello, this is the first line of input
This is the second line
And this is the third line
/exit
EOF

# Example 2: Different marker name
test.command <<END
You can use different markers
END, DATA, INPUT, etc.
END

# Example 3: Preserving whitespace
format.test <<SPACES
  This line has 2 leading spaces
    This line has 4 leading spaces
\tThis line has a tab
SPACES

# Example 4: Empty heredoc
empty.test <<EMPTY
EMPTY

# Example 5: Multiple heredocs in one script
first.command <<DATA1
First command input
DATA1

second.command <<DATA2
Second command input
DATA2

# Regular commands still work normally between heredocs
help
about
status

# Example 6: Multi-line conversation simulation
# conversation.example <<CHAT
# What is the weather like?
# Can you tell me more?
# Thank you!
# /exit
# CHAT

# Comments and blank lines work as expected

# End of demo
